Web Scraping With R

Project to extract spatial and non-spatial data for rural properties in the Brazilian Amazonian state of Par√° from a public repository http://car.semas.pa.gov.br/

Project will create a clear pipeline to regularly extract this data and display it via a shiny app.

<u>Instructions for use</u>
1. Run get_car3.R. This will produce a .csv file with the scraped data. 
2. Not yet automated - we reduced the .csv file to a subset of the rows and columns for demonstration.
3. Run either the server.R or ui.R file in the shiny-app folder. The reduced .csv is used by the scripts to create an interactive webpage.
